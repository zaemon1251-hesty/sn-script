    - game => 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
    - previous comments => Some good forwards here, was it the heel of Chambers that just took it away? => Just there. It's an important touch. Without Murtosaka, Koselnick, they'd be vulnerable on set-pieces. These are always awkward to defend.
    - comment => Still standing firm, 25 minutes gone, 0-0.

    - game => 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
    - previous comments => What an impact he can have. Is he who takes the corner kick? Wendel sends it back. It's not the kind of quality that Çalhanoğlu had from a dead ball in a similar position. Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Çalhanoğlu.
    - comment => Six of them were free kicks.

    - game => 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
    - previous comments => Once again Werner, the flags go up when he goes there. That's again under the motto, should I dissolve myself in the air? But again, good, but actually Kaiser slipped away beforehand. And here it is not a free kick. The reds have already seen that correctly.
    - comment => As a central defender, I don't know how Badr is under pressure.

    - game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
    - previous comments: He then sprinted into the middle. It was too strong for Marquinhos at the far post. And Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marseille score from their first real opportunity.
    - comment: A terrific season as a Marseille player.

    - game: 2015-02-21 - 17-30 Paderborn 0 - 6 Bayern Munich
    - previous comments: With five remis and five defeats. André Breitenreiter said we turned the game around. The problem is today a whole three-time goal hall with a feeling of 30 boxes from the south of the republic. Rupp, Hünemeier, Hartherz. With possession of the ball the two outside defenders push into the middle field and support Bakalots and Rupp.
    - comment: Meaning Heinlot, the young man here on the ball and Hartherz on the other side.

    - game: 2015-02-21 - 17-30 Paderborn 0 - 6 Bayern Munich
    - previous comments: But I would have liked the right defender to at least try to exert pressure on the Frenchman, who could then play relatively relaxed on Lewandowski.
    - comment: Robben against Ziegler.

    - previous comments:  A long, long way away from France. But he did well. Pastore scored his first goal with Argentina.
    - comment: And the Argentine is enjoying quite a renaissance at the moment.

    - game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
    - previous comments: The West Brom players. Led by Chris Brunt, who's one of the most experienced men. In words with Mark Clattenburg.
    - comment: He's made it clear to Zuma that he saw what happened.

    - game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
    - previous_comments: He's in for Gary Cahill. And you have a bit of insight into Cahill's... Yes, just been speaking with him at the Chelsea camp and they said that Gary's been working all week with a protective mask on. Asmir Begovic caught him in the face at Manchester City and actually broke his nose and gave him a gash on the cheekbone. So it's not been a comfortable week's work for him.
    - comment: So in some ways I'm sure that would have had a bearing on the Zouma decision as well.

  - game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
  - previous comments: Xavi Martinez and Holger Babskoeber still injured. Kosta with the cross. Couldn't pick out Muller or Lewandowski on this occasion but he has been the greatest Bayern threat. Well again 1v1 he's so quick. Can't believe these Leverkusen defenders are trying to nip the ball off him.
  - comment: I think they're just going to drop in and into shape and not allow that space to run into but something they'll have to adjust.

    game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
    previous comments: I think the necessity of the club is that they've got to win games straight away. I think that if they do lose today, it would come under some pressure, Arsene Wenger.
    comment: Speaking to fans before the game, they certainly weren't coming into the ground on spy, I don't know whether you felt the same thing, Martin.

      - previous comments: It is not effective. Rieto touched. Mustera. We will leave the first 15 minutes later. There is no clear position in both goals.
      - comment: There is a moment when Atletico Madrid checks the goal twice.
