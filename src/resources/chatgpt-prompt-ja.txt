    - comment => Still standing firm, 25 minutes gone, 0-0.
    - game => 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
    - previous_comments => Some good forwards here, was it the heel of Chambers that just took it away? => Just there. It's an important touch. Without Murtosaka, Koselnick, they'd be vulnerable on set-pieces. These are always awkward to defend.

    - comment => Six of them were free kicks.
    - game => 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
    - previous_comments => What an impact he can have. Is he who takes the corner kick? Wendel sends it back. It's not the kind of quality that Çalhanoğlu had from a dead ball in a similar position. Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Çalhanoğlu.

    - comment => As a central defender, I don't know how Badr is under pressure.
    - game => 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
    - previous_comments => Once again Werner, the flags go up when he goes there. That's again under the motto, should I dissolve myself in the air? But again, good, but actually Kaiser slipped away beforehand. And here it is not a free kick. The reds have already seen that correctly.

    - comment: A terrific season as a Marseille player.
    - game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
    - previous_comments: He then sprinted into the middle. It was too strong for Marquinhos at the far post. And Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marseille score from their first real opportunity.

    - comment: Meaning Heinlot, the young man here on the ball and Hartherz on the other side.
    - game: 2015-02-21 - 17-30 Paderborn 0 - 6 Bayern Munich
    - previous_comments: With five remis and five defeats. André Breitenreiter said we turned the game around. The problem is today a whole three-time goal hall with a feeling of 30 boxes from the south of the republic. Rupp, Hünemeier, Hartherz. With possession of the ball the two outside defenders push into the middle field and support Bakalots and Rupp.
