- previous comments => It's so tight in the middle and bottom of the table, that bottom half separated by just four or six points from top of the mid table to bottom. Depor of course one of several teams in the bottom half of the table who picked up wins last weekend, so it really is as Duncan said very tight down the bottom.
- comment => Depor will come out obviously looking to defend their goal especially over the first 20 minutes or so.

- comment => That's why the great good of European football covered his signature.


- game => 2017-01-21 - 19-00 Nantes 0 - 2 Paris SG
- previous comments => On the first situation, almost Julien for the Parisians We know that it was a lot of work this week And especially yesterday at the video With the right-side shift where we felt that the Nantais were a bit more vulnerable defensively With Amin Harit who doesn't always get back where he was needed With Lima who is not necessarily the best defender or defensively of this team We saw that with the shift of Draxler for Lucas, in one touch He had this intelligence, this spontaneity The little Brazilian Elie, Cavani of course I confirm what you tell me with his special call to the first post And after a little kick that deceives Maxime Dupé It's sumptuous, it's remarkable, it's cold like realism But we can only admire The offensive triple is on target Julien Draxler, penultimate for Lucas who serves Cavani It changes the game for the Nantais Under the eyes of Lo Celso and Di Maria Lo Celso is a big fan of Di Maria Who has evolved in the same club as him, Rosario Central in Argentina And Sergio Contessao has already sent the warm-up, Edgar Pardo and Adrien Thomasson To evolve on the sides eventually Edgar Pardo, the recruit lent by Olympiacos Well played, Errongier Salah, passed in front of Thiago Mota It's in And we come back to the start of the action A good refereeing by Johan Amel I didn't necessarily see him in that direction this time Look, after Salah he has the benefit of the ball From the moment he has the benefit of the ball I don't see how we can come back after On a foul, even if the Nantais player who could have been the victim of the foul could have given it Koufran, in any case 23 minutes of play At the Bois-Jouar, it's Amin Harit Who seems to want to take charge of this stopped phase And Unai Emery is in charge of building the wall He's the one who's in charge, he's the boss, the Spanish On a stopped kick, we can't say it's an absolute force for Nantes Last year, they didn't score a single goal on a stopped phase in Ligue 1 This year, just one penalty and one goal on corner Here it's a Koufran with Lima finally Diego Carlos who puts the ball aside The coaches pass, but for the moment we stay in a similar family statistics At Nantes, at the level of stopped kicks The goalkeeper is in the box Kevin Trapp looking for a solution We know that the will is to start short There were solutions on the sides, but the Nantes pressing is so high and so constant There was no possibility, there was this obligation to play longer And behind, to lose the ball Which now allows Lima to find himself against Thomas Meunier BAMU For Lima Right centre, we saw it was harder for the Brazilian And it's quickly taken back by the Nantes The Canaries lead the score, but they take the ball back BAMU Well played To break the first line, to find BAMU directly BAMU, caught in the flu these last weeks, these last months By a part of the Bojoire's fans There was a long article on this subject in West France Since the first match against PSG There was a bad reaction from his partner Aristeguieta Yet he doesn't give up, we can still see the Moroccan international Who saw with pleasure yesterday the success of the Lions of Atlas against Togo A Moroccan who is starting again in the qualification race In the Africa Cup of Nations To follow in full on live on BEANSPORT There will be a decisive last match in Morocco-Ivory Coast It won't be good Who promises MOTAR With Meunier Salah With a return from Verratti But it's true In favor of the Nantes No worries There the advantage didn't profit Exactly Dubois with the call of Iloki Well felt by Thiago Silva It's the same as earlier We position ourselves in front of the opponent for the Parisian We see Draxler's ball-taking What a ball Lucas puts a ball in one touch He is on the ground, he doesn't move And he is perfectly balanced Because he has to support him a lot To not allow the defender to intervene And he is in the position To touch the ball And he must be perfectly balanced In the depth with Cavani's call Which was remarkable And which wasn't out of play Lucas that we find now to alert Marco Verratti He has some great stats too The Brazilian this season Lucas with a center Which will be recovered by Dupay All mixed competition If we put the cup The Champions League together Lucas now with 11 goals And 7 decisive passes Not bad But he is the most used player So it's easier To have important stats But it's what we blamed him for And now he is crossing a threshold Thanks to his recovered stats The stats he can recover A little more on this upcoming corner Lucas for the corner Thiago Silva for the header It's a classic And it's him we were looking for Well taken by this in the duel He can't take it Because it was considered A kind of trickery I didn't count The card Hop hop hop Everyone has to go out I didn't understand We'll see I would like to The yellow card for Marco Verratti I have the impression That he plays with the rules That he gives the ball With his head But since the goalkeeper didn't take it It's more surprising We'll see It's surprising But why not It's the problem If Trapp doesn't take it It's less embarrassing He doesn't take it Trapp! Trapp!
- comment => Trapp!

- game => 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
