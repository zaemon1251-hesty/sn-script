user:
  - comment => Still standing firm, 25 minutes gone, 0-0.
  - game => 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
  - previous_comments => Some good forwards here, was it the heel of Chambers that just took it away? Just there. It's an important touch. Without Murtosaka, Koselnick, they'd be vulnerable on set-pieces. These are always awkward to defend.

user:
  - comment => Six of them were free kicks.
  - game => 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
  - previous_comments => What an impact he can have. Is he who takes the corner kick? Wendel sends it back. It's not the kind of quality that Çalhanoğlu had from a dead ball in a similar position. Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Çalhanoğlu.

user:
- comment => As a central defender, I don't know how Badr is under pressure.
- game => 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
- previous_comments => Once again Werner, the flags go up when he goes there. That's again under the motto, should I dissolve myself in the air? But again, good, but actually Kaiser slipped away beforehand. And here it is not a free kick. The reds have already seen that correctly.
