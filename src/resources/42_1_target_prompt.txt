- comment: You can definitely run up to Ludwig, who shows weaknesses more often in the game, the Russian goalkeeper.
- game: 2014-11-04 - 20-00 Zenit Petersburg 1 - 2 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Hulk is the man to take it out of the game. He has scored four of the last six Champions League goals for Zenit. Zidane! Zidane! Let's go in there.


- comment: So, and he is usually the better one at the Red Bull Nobel.
- game: 2014-11-04 - 20-00 Zenit Petersburg 1 - 2 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: In this case, Leno would not have been so completely innocent. But always difficult for a goalkeeper. Such a situation. The duel of the two Italians. On the right side of the Leverkusen, Giulio Donati and Domenico Crescito.


- comment: A good action from the guests, as now with Kershak.
- game: 2014-11-04 - 20-00 Zenit Petersburg 1 - 2 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: No doubt, the topic of this season at Bayern. The attack, especially at the start of the season. They played really well and really strong. The topic is the balance, which is often missing. That was also seen here, when they move up wide.


- comment: I mean Real Madrid in theory should be happy.
- game: 2015-02-14 - 20-00 Real Madrid 2 - 0 Dep. La Coruna
- previous comments: Bale a few whistles there for Gareth Bale as well and it's another one of you. You always get stories. When you're watching Real Madrid the same I suppose could be said of Barcelona. There's always so many stories isn't there. It's not just about the three points.


- comment: That shot against the crossbar will have boosted Real Madrid.
- game: 2015-02-14 - 20-00 Real Madrid 2 - 0 Dep. La Coruna
- previous comments: Well he's a player who can conjure up space from nothing. Such good footwork. Isco, excellent control as well from long balls over and he can just get that extra meter where you can get the ball across. Real Madrid beginning to dominate over the last two minutes or so. It's one of those storms that Deportivo La Coruña will have to weather because now Real Madrid are finding their groove a bit.


- comment: Cruz.
- game: 2015-02-14 - 20-00 Real Madrid 2 - 0 Dep. La Coruna
- previous comments: Now Real Madrid just breaking up play. Inside for Ilaria. Ilaria will find Isco. Isco out of bounds. A little knock there from Borges.


- comment: He's been taken under the wing by Victor Fernandez but he's going to be slightly off the pace whatever and you're going up against arguably the most potent strike force in all of the Liga if not Europe.
- game: 2015-02-14 - 20-00 Real Madrid 2 - 0 Dep. La Coruna
- previous comments: He's pulled forward. Paul won and it's Real Madrid in possession now with Rafael Valen. Potentially it is a very dangerous move to have Manuel Pablo in a fullback. Never played there and he's not well he might be matched but he's spent most of his time on the bench this season rather than playing. Attempting to move into a more managerial role.


- game: 2015-02-21 - 17-30 Paderborn 0 - 6 Bayern Munich
- previous comments: With five remis and five defeats. André Breitenreiter said we turned the game around. The problem is today a whole three-time goal hall with a feeling of 30 boxes from the south of the republic. Rupp, Hünemeier, Hartherz. With possession of the ball the two outside defenders push into the middle field and support Bakalots and Rupp.
- comment: Meaning Heinlot, the young man here on the ball and Hartherz on the other side.


- comment: Heinlot.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 17-30 Paderborn 0 - 6 Bayern Munich
- previous comments: Robben. And Müller. Rafinha is waiting on the right. Müller, chipped in for Lewandowski. Kacunga against Alaba.


- comment: Robben against Ziegler.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 17-30 Paderborn 0 - 6 Bayern Munich
- previous comments: And that's the 2-0 again. This fake shot, this one-two. And that's the 2-0 again. This fake shot by Müller was difficult for Heinold, because the distance to Ribéry was very far. But I would have liked the right defender to at least try to exert pressure on the Frenchman, who could then play relatively relaxed on Lewandowski.


- comment: Another loss.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: It ends up causing Chelsea to be completely torn apart. The shot between the three sticks. Very dangerous. Good pass. Courtois has finally settled it.


- comment: The goalkeeper is in the box.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: Let's see that ball that was behind. Arfield couldn't get it. But Danny Ings did well. This player who interests Real Sociedad, and who should have good references, David Moyes. He should know him well, of course.


- comment: Ivanovic again, but the player is from Eden Hazard.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: Hazard again. He's inside the box. What a fantastic move by the Belgian. Ivanovic. Ivanovic again.


- comment: In the disputes, the central defenders of the Vali are with their rear-view mirrors open.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: Let's see some repetition. With that ball from the square back to the launch of Branislav Ivanovic. He jumped to Orakin. He is a good player. Osk, do you have any comments about the Catalan player?


- comment: Philippe for Oscar.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: We're getting closer to the first half. Chelsea win 1-0. It's a game where Mourinho's team are doing their best to win but they haven't yet secured a win. They haven't won yet as they're the smallest of scorers. Everything you can win by 1-0 is always very dangerous.


- comment: Even a good referee can see it.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: Ivanovic is so high up. Another hard pass. He's going to miss the first one because Boyd-Oscar was going for it. It's a clear shot. This one is more obvious.


- comment: He's trying to surprise the Valcanico.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: He's fast to the other side. Ivanovic is there. He's offered a square to win the backline. He's closed the backline. It's a great cross from Servio.


- comment: He's been chased by Shaquille.
- game: 2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley
- previous comments: Philippe closes the gap well in front of Trippier. Philippe-Louis is very firm. Ivanovic. With Hazard. Diego Costa's manoeuvre to break the gap.


- comment: Florian Thauvin.
- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: The downside is that now the fans are all armed with bits of paper that they're screwing up and throwing on. Marquinhos. Morel clears. Zsigniak heads down. Djerdjaje.


- comment: Mendy.
- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: Dmitry Payet full of confidence at the moment. Happy to try this sort of effort. Juggling the ball on his head and then letting fly with his left foot. Six goals this season. 12 assists for the most creative player in the league this season.


- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: Although it's just going to beat Marquinhos. Javier Pastore, one of a host of players to have been involved in international matches. A long, long way away from France. But he did well. Pastore scored his first goal with Argentina.
- comment: And the Argentine is enjoying quite a renaissance at the moment.


- comment: Going down.
- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: I don't think he can have complaints about that yellow card. It is a real stranglehold. Is this within David Luiz or Ibrahimovic's range? Fanny with the clearance. David Luiz again.


- comment: Gignac arrives and Gignac scores!
- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: He's done well. Thiago Silva clearing, throwing to Marseille. Gignac. Cleverly switching the play to Payet. Payet's cross, far post.


- comment: A terrific season as a Marseille player.
- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: He then sprinted into the middle. It was too strong for Marquinhos at the far post. And Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marseille score from their first real opportunity.


- comment: Marquinhos spotting a bit of space to run into.
- game: 2015-04-05 - 22-00 Marseille 2 - 3 Paris SG
- previous comments: It was always going to be a concern for Bielsa. And now it's a bit of a challenge for PSG. PSG no question are on top in the midfield battle. It was always going to be a concern for Bielsa. Thiago Silva.


- game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
- previous comments: of the baggies and the current champions. West Brom in the strikes.
- comment: And this immediately is Callum McManaman finding Craig Dawson.


- game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
- previous comments: He's in for Gary Cahill. And you have a bit of insight into Cahill's... Yes, just been speaking with him at the Chelsea camp and they said that Gary's been working all week with a protective mask on. Asmir Begovic caught him in the face at Manchester City and actually broke his nose and gave him a gash on the cheekbone. So it's not been a comfortable week's work for him.
- comment: So in some ways I'm sure that would have had a bearing on the Zouma decision as well.


- comment: And a break for Jakob.
- game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
- previous comments: Costa down on the floor for the first time, not for the last. Here's Fabregas. Hazard. Costa's picked himself back up. Ivanovic.


- comment: Now Willian.
- game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
- previous comments: Just need the numbers in there. I think it was James McLean, very unlucky, but he couldn't supply the finishing touch there. Interesting to see if Mark Clattenburg goes back and talks to Zouma after a late challenge that has left Morrison limping. Hasn't yet been a break in play. Pedro to Fabregas.


- game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
- previous comments: The West Brom players. Led by Chris Brunt, who's one of the most experienced men. In words with Mark Clattenburg.
- comment: He's made it clear to Zuma that he saw what happened.


- comment: Gives it up for Morrison.
- game: 2015-08-23 - 15-30 West Brom 2 - 3 Chelsea
- previous comments: Well, maybe. I mean, listen, lots do it, but... I don't think they should. Costa. Pedro.


- comment: What an impression he's made on Bayern and what a remarkable achievement it would be if he could produce that unprecedented fourth consecutive Bundesliga title.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Good enough to get into the Germany squad again for their Euro qualifiers against Poland and Scotland coming up over the next 10 days or so. First corner kick of the evening though for Maya Leverkusen. It's the dual threat of Bellarabi and Calhanoglu who wandered over towards him. Calhanoglu it is who takes. Alonso again getting to it first.


- comment: It's a game that we brought you here on BT Sport and it was a stunning performance from Roger Schmid's side to see off the Italians from 1-0 down in the first leg.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Costa, Robben, Tarr with a crucial touch but it needs clearing. Leverkusen opting to run it out. That is a measure of the confidence that Leverkusen come into the game with. One of the goal scorers in midweek as they beat Lazio 3-0. Karim Bellarabi.


- comment: Kiesling was back to deal with it.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: He went down. I think he realised if Douglas Costa gets away he's going to run at that back four. And that's his job to protect. But another yellow card for Leverkusen. Another opportunity for Xabi Alonso to get forward and take a buy in free kick.


- comment: Manchester United or Manchester City.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Well he won't find a better club and he won't find a better city. So a lot of the players at Bayern Munich used to say once you leave Bayern Munich you probably won't find a better club and that was often the case but I think there's only a handful of clubs you could ever go to.


- comment: Here he is looking to add to the 75.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Great first touch from Douglas Costa. Four touches in in the back of the net and Thomas Müller such a great feel for the game. I don't think there's any player like him in European football. He just always pops up at the right time. No current Bayern player has scored more Bundesliga goals than Thomas Müller.


- comment: Great switch from Alonso.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: He has marked his 200th league appearance for Bayern in fine style as well with the opening goal in the game and all that hard work that Leverkusen have done amounts to nothing. The story is a familiar one. Bayern are winning at home. Well up to that point it was a relatively even game. I thought Leverkusen had done a good job but when you give Bayern a bit of space to play then they realise Leverkusen pressing so much.


- comment: Well if there was a vulnerability about Bayern last season domestically it was against the other sides near the top of the table.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Again Robben with space to get in behind. I think it just comes off his shin Douglas Costa. Doesn't get a clean contact and it comes off the post but so has just seen Bayern Munich dominate possession. But I think Bayern Munich on the counter attack when they won the treble under Jupp Heynckes they played a lot on the counter attack in the big games. If you give these top players space to run in behind and create they're so lethal.


- comment: Six of them were free kicks.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: What an impact he can have. Is he who takes the corner kick? Wendel sends it back. It's not the kind of quality that Çalhanoğlu had from a dead ball in a similar position. Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Çalhanoğlu.


- game: 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
- previous comments: Xavi Martinez and Holger Babskoeber still injured. Kosta with the cross. Couldn't pick out Muller or Lewandowski on this occasion but he has been the greatest Bayern threat. Well again 1v1 he's so quick. Can't believe these Leverkusen defenders are trying to nip the ball off him.
- comment: I think they're just going to drop in and into shape and not allow that space to run into but something they'll have to adjust.


- comment: He's for Suarez.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: And Ivan Rakitic is back. Suarez, corner of the box. A rebound for Sergio and Roberto. He's behind. He's on the right wing.


- comment: Intensity in the attack of the Barcelona football club.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: Busquets. He doesn't hit him with his head. Sergio Busquets. And there were no problems for Kamen in this case. Intensity.


- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: Because all the others are international. And many also.

- comment: For Luis Enrique's team, there are two coaches, Roberto Rodríguez, who sit down a little.


- comment: Finally, Andres Iniesta is supported.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: And Rakitic returns to play, Mascherano. The send to the other central defender, Thomas Vermaelen, opens the Belgian. He does it for Jordi Alba. Francasio, Barrancas and Correchate included. The ball continues to be on the left side.


- comment: A shot that doesn't go anywhere good for Barça.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: Ivan Rakitic's shot. It's a clash between the two. Neymar leaves it behind. It's a direct pass to Jordi Alba. Alba with Neymar, Roberto Rosales presses him.


- comment: In the final sprint of the first half.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: Although the referee is missing. Now he's going to show the first yellow card of the game. Arrecio. Ball stopped for Barça. Messi.


- comment: Iniesta.
- game: 2015-08-29 - 21-30 Barcelona 1 - 0 Malaga
- previous comments: Malaga has recovered. Busquets' header. Ver Maelen's minimal run up. He had taken his place in the box. Messi.

- previous comments: This is the goal to continue in the Champions League in the first two rows to get out of the group. The European League will continue in the third row. A long-distance pass. A chance for Atletico Madrid. But a quick ball for Bieto.


- comment: Luciano Vieto.
- game: 2015-09-15 - 21-45 Galatasaray 0 - 2 Atl. Madrid
- previous comments: Jackson Martinez. They were in that area. But the last shot was not effective. Very comfortable. Moussera controlled.


- game: 2015-09-15 - 21-45 Galatasaray 0 - 2 Atl. Madrid
- previous comments: It is not effective. Rieto touched. Mustera. We will leave the first 15 minutes later. There is no clear position in both goals.
- comment: There is a moment when Atletico Madrid checks the goal twice.


- comment: Rieto.
- game: 2015-09-15 - 21-45 Galatasaray 0 - 2 Atl. Madrid
- previous comments: Jackson Martinez is waiting for the pass at a far point. Semih. Very comfortable. He did it with the second shot. Sneijder couldn't take it.


- comment: Bessi Snyder made the middle.
- game: 2015-09-15 - 21-45 Galatasaray 0 - 2 Atl. Madrid
- previous comments: The best chance for Galatasaray. The 23rd minute. Semih is rising here. He is using the position that excites the fans. Snyder is using it.

- game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
- previous comments: Watching briefs for one of France's players in the Euro 2016 final. I think there definitely is a point. I think that sports science has a big impact now on what happens in team selection. I think the necessity of the club is that they've got to win games straight away. I think that if they do lose today, it would come under some pressure, Arsene Wenger.
- comment: Speaking to fans before the game, they certainly weren't coming into the ground on spy, I don't know whether you felt the same thing, Martin.


- game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
- previous comments: Some good forwards here, was it the heel of Chambers that just took it away? Just there. It's an important touch. Without Murtosaka, Koselnick, they'd be vulnerable on set-pieces. These are always awkward to defend.
- comment: Still standing firm, 25 minutes gone, 0-0.


- game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
- previous comments: And they're having at it, the penalty. The chance to convert the penalty. 29 minutes gone, and it's Minilay, as he did famously on his Liverpool debut, saves a penalty on an opening day of the season. Big celebrations from Liverpool. Minilay, the perfect penalty height, it's a poor one from Theo Wook up.
- comment: Keepers love it at that height.


- game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
- previous comments: Ramsey. Mane. Tintin by Sanchez. Wins the header too. Mane.
- comment: Arsenal's confidence at the moment, both the holding midfield players were pushing up to join in the attack.


- comment: Liverpool lead to Barcelona.
- game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
- previous comments: Wijnaldum. Scored 11 Premier League goals for Newcastle last season, all at home. Liverpool looking for some away day trust here. It hasn't been very conspicuous in the first third of the game. Liverpool give themselves a chance to play with confidence.


- comment: Alberto Moreno.
- game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
- previous comments: Free kick given Arsenal's way. Mimele not really going for it. Believe it or not, Arsene Wenger facing Liverpool for the 50th time as manager of Arsenal. Some Premier League managers don't get 50 games in total. Confirmation of that booking for Francis Coquelain.


- comment: I think Juventus' transfer is more important.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina

- previous comments: Juventus have two moments. The match is on. But the draw is 0-0. They stopped the match. He passed the ball.


- comment: Di Balla plays the ball to Dani Alves.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: Apparently, he got some damage, because he was not on the list of injured before the match. Indeed. Apparently, Borja Valero has some health problems. The designer of the Florentine attack. Paolo Di Balla will serve.


- comment: He won the Champions League several times.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: But Delini played unwisely. Alves saves the ball. Dani Alves has overdone it. It seems that he is a little worried. The first match is officially declared for him.

- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: The Argentinean simply could not handle the ball. Dybala praised Allegri in the summer. He said that he was getting stronger compared to last season. Allegri's forecast is that Dybala will be one of the three best footballers in the world in the next few years. If we know that the two best footballers in the world in the last 10 years are Messi and Ronaldo, then, apparently, Dybala should be the third.


- comment: Massimiliano Allegri.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: Chiesa. Good wall from Bernardeschi. Chiesa! You know, Chiesa leaves a very pleasant impression. As if this is not his first game in the Italian series, but some kind of tradition to come to Juventus Stadium and torture the defenders of the Italian national team for Federico Chiesa.


- comment: Petrushan has to score again.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: He tried to spin the ball with a twist, but it didn't work. Let's watch the Argentinean's shot again. Well, such a ball he scored in the last season for Juventus. So far, in this season, half an hour after the first game. And so far 0-0 Juventus-Fiorentina.


- comment: Undoubtedly, he is qualified for the most important role.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: And the whole new line of halfbacks. Yes, there is Pjanic. It's a pleasant event for Juve. That Juventus was able to buy out Roma. But on the other hand, in the rest, young Lemina.


- comment: Dybala again with the ball.
- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: Fedira. Barzali. Kalinic. Pass to the left flank. Dybala.

- game: 2016-08-20 - 18-00 Juventus 2 - 1 Fiorentina
- previous comments: It was not enough to take the goal literally a meter. Even Buffon is a bit shocked by this episode. Teterushano. Teterushano had the European Championship in the Romanian national team. Not the best, although Teterushano played well.


- comment: But that's how it can also go.
- game: 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
- previous comments: They do that very well, also just now with Schürrle and Schmelzer. Leipzig stays true, but they are also impressed by what Dortmund and how Dortmund plays here. Goetze. Demme, good ball. Kaiser, Werner.


- comment: So, okay, I think that's standard now, although everyone else saw that there was something.
- game: 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
- previous comments: And BVB is under-supplied in the last third. There are hardly any balls in the last third, so that they can really play offensively. So really defensively a very, very good performance from Leipzig. The defensive player Christoph Metzeler asks. And Pausen asks again, but there was nothing.


- comment: But again, good, but actually Kaiser slipped away beforehand.
- game: 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
- previous comments: Now nonsense hardness is coming into play here. Werner. Piszczek a bit unhappy. Once again Werner, the flags go up when he goes there. That's again under the motto, should I dissolve myself in the air?


- comment: As a central defender, I don't know how Badr is under pressure.
- game: 2016-09-10 - 19-30 RB Leipzig 1 - 0 Dortmund
- previous comments: Once again Werner, the flags go up when he goes there. That's again under the motto, should I dissolve myself in the air? But again, good, but actually Kaiser slipped away beforehand. And here it is not a free kick. The reds have already seen that correctly.

- previous comments: Like last week in Rennes, the Parisians will count on Cavani, Lucas and Draxler. And if there is noise in the stands, there will also be agitation on the benches. Latin atmosphere, Renan Chodotal. So, Renan who seems to have a little problem with us. The game that continues.


- comment: No, because it's cut by Leo Dubois.
- game: 2017-01-21 - 19-00 Nantes 0 - 2 Paris SG
- previous comments: And it will be the area where Roland Draxler will evolve a lot. It's not terrible, the field, in a way, insofar as there are a lot of areas without a very flat and very fluid grass. And as it's not frozen but it's hard enough, given the climatic conditions, the ball may jump a lot. There may be small control problems. We'll see that now.


- comment: The championship is very exciting.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: 0-1 to Eibar in the game we're watching. The Japanese come to the pitch. Ter Stegen scores the first goal. Real Madrid now have a huge lead in the league title. But there's still a lot of time left.


- comment: Malaga are trying to put pressure on them.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: 0-1 at the Camp Nou. Cristiano Ronaldo's goal was a dream. But also Leiva's goal. Isco is helping. The game for Madrid is under control.


- comment: It's perfect for Isco.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: He can't get it in for the third. He rejects it. It's in for Marcelo. Marcelo is offside. He's got a ball in.


- comment: Malaga's pressure is going down to the floor to get the ball out for Mikel.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Fornals are a bit more aggressive, but they're not disturbing Madrid. I think Madrid are very comfortable. The ball is in for Toni Kroos. The game has changed. Madrid are quickly and easily in the lead.


- comment: Danilo's fallen asleep.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: He's trying to get it out. They've got Joni short. There's Isco. Fornals are up. There's no offside.


- comment: He's caught the ball.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Sandro's in danger. He's in the box. He's short. He's looking for the shot. Malaga's first.


- comment: Two points for Malaga and two points for Barcelona.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: 43-1. Real Madrid are very close to the league title. They're up 6 points from Barcelona. Barça are very close to the cup. Real Madrid have four points ahead of them.


- comment: ...doesn't participate in the play.
- game: 2017-05-21 - 21-00 Malaga 0 - 2 Real Madrid
- previous comments: He's got a penalty. Camacho. I'm going to tell you something. There are important offside plays. But the offside manoeuvre is that Sandro... That's what I was going to say.


- comment: He passes it to Casemiro to pick up the ball.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Fran Beltran's pass to Denis. Sensational. The first move of Salceda. Another free-kick. Denis wants more.


- comment: A wonderful pass from Denis.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: The game has started at full speed. Celta get the ball back. They play in the defensive line with Lucas Olaza. Especially at full speed. More than a passing speed.


- comment: So it will be a goal kick.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Gareth Bale. He profiles. He looks for the inside pass. Benzema about to cushion that ball. I think the ball came out to go back in after Ruben Blanco's block.


- comment: The assist is from Gareth Bale.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: The play can be reviewed by the VAR. Yes, but I think, in this shot, I don't think it's a foul. For now, Estrada is scoring the goal and scoring yellow for Aspas, who have been amonestated for protesting. It's Karim Benzema's goal. In the beginning, Vinicius' shot could have appeared.


- comment: Denis, more from Brais, Brais in the first, the bull does not arrive, the rebound can favor Aspas.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: It is the turn of the Celta's replica, with Olaza, who slows down a little, what seemed to be a frenetic exit of the team of Fran Escriba. Brais Mendes. Kevin delivers to the center, and in Distribuyes, Fran Beltran, he claims it on the left, Olaza. Araujo. Good maneuver by Brais, he is facing Casemiro, pass with a pipe included.


- comment: Modric got into a trap, he wanted to get out of it, provoking a corner.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: It is as if they were more willing to take care of what they have than to go and look for the possibility of a second goal. Lucas Olaza made a mess, he knew how to take advantage of it, Bale, so that the band is for Real Madrid. You also see many comments on the field, interacting, Ramos with Marcelo, gestures also from Modric, from Toni Kroos, from Casemiro, from Karim Benzema, even conversations with Bale. Real Madrid is very involved in the game. Conversations inside and outside the field, because they also had them, we saw it there in that section of the stands, as well as Mallo and Santimina, two players that surely Franescriba would like to have available today.


- comment: Well, no, it was finally Marcelo's hand.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Now the claim of the card is for the repetition of the foul, right? That was what Denis was claiming. Marcelo's hand is taken and it seems that the referee indicates it. It will be a draw. A draw for what Marc has pointed out the assistant.


- comment: Lobotka, pressed by Kroos.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Modric follows, Bale asks for it on the right. He tried the inside pass for Vinicius. He deactivates the attack action. Denis wants to make a mess. Again, Odriozola.


- comment: He's in a hurry to get Ruben.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Kroos. He's on the back. Casemiro. Ruben Blanco. Madrid worked well.


- comment: He's got it again.
- game: 2019-08-17 - 18-00 Celta Vigo 1 - 3 Real Madrid
- previous comments: Surrounded by Celta shirts. He has to play back to Odriozola. He presses Iago Aspas. He's got it. He chooses the shortstop, Thibaut Courtois.
