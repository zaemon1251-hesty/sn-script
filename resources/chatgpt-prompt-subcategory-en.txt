    - game => 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
    - previous comments => Some good forwards here, was it the heel of Chambers that just took it away? => Just there. It's an important touch. Without Murtosaka, Koselnick, they'd be vulnerable on set-pieces. These are always awkward to defend.
    - comment => Still standing firm, 25 minutes gone, 0-0.

    - game => 2015-08-29 - 19-30 Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer Leverkusen
    - previous comments => What an impact he can have. Is he who takes the corner kick? Wendel sends it back. It's not the kind of quality that Çalhanoğlu had from a dead ball in a similar position. Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Çalhanoğlu.
    - comment => Six of them were free kicks.

    game: 2016-08-14 - 18-00 Arsenal 3 - 4 Liverpool
    previous comments: I think the necessity of the club is that they've got to win games straight away. I think that if they do lose today, it would come under some pressure, Arsene Wenger.
    comment: Speaking to fans before the game, they certainly weren't coming into the ground on spy, I don't know whether you felt the same thing, Martin.

    - game: 2015-09-15 - 21-45 Galatasaray 0 - 2 Atl. Madrid
    - previous comments: It is not effective. Rieto touched. Mustera. We will leave the first 15 minutes later. There is no clear position in both goals.
    - comment: There is a moment when Atletico Madrid checks the goal twice.
