      - previous comments => It's not the kind of quality that Çalhanoğlu had from a dead ball in a similar position. Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Çalhanoğlu.
      - comment => Six of them were free kicks.

      - previous comments => Marcelo Bielsa vindicated in his team selection, picking Gignac ahead of Batshuayi. Marseille score from their first real opportunity.
      - comment => A terrific season as a Marseille player.

      - previous comments =>  But he did well. Pastore scored his first goal with Argentina.
      - comment => And the Argentine is enjoying quite a renaissance at the moment.

      - previous comments => The West Brom players. Led by Chris Brunt, who's one of the most experienced men. In words with Mark Clattenburg.
      - comment => He's made it clear to Zuma that he saw what happened.

      - previous_comments => Asmir Begovic caught him in the face at Manchester City and actually broke his nose and gave him a gash on the cheekbone. So it's not been a comfortable week's work for him.
      - comment => So in some ways I'm sure that would have had a bearing on the Zouma decision as well.

      - previous comments => It is not effective. Rieto touched. Mustera. We will leave the first 15 minutes later. There is no clear position in both goals.
      - comment => There is a moment when Atletico Madrid checks the goal twice.

  #     - previous comments => Some good forwards here, was it the heel of Chambers that just took it away? => Just there. It's an important touch. Without Murtosaka, Koselnick, they'd be vulnerable on set-pieces. These are always awkward to defend.
  #     - comment => Still standing firm, 25 minutes gone, 0-0.
